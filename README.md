# Predict-image

Project using machine learning to predict images

This a class project where I had to create a program which save user preferences for images and had to use machine learning to predict and propose new images that the user can like.

The profile.py file create the user preferences and save it into a Json file, and the predictImage.py file, train the neuronal network and use machine learning to predict an image that the user can like.
